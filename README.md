# Digit-Classifier

This project was aimed for the classification of Handwritten digits using the MNIST Dataset. The project was implemented in two phases .

- [x] Using Numpy and Writing code for Forward Propagation and Backward Propagation from scratch.

- [x] Using Convolutional Neural Networks with Pytorch Framework.

WIth Numpy  accuracy obtained are 

-Training accuracy of 96.73 %

-Test accuracy of  96.21 %

With CNN accuracy obtained are 

-Training accuracy of 99%

-Test accuracy of 98.98%
